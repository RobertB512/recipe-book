        This is another recipe to add to your "ways to cook eggs" book. It's light and fluffy, like a cloud. The structure is a whipped up egg white with a yolk on top.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp white vinegar</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp unsalted butter, or as needed</li>

      <h2>Directions</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone liner (such as SilpatÂ®) and butter lightly.</li>
        <li>Crack 1 egg into a clean hand and then separate carefully by letting the egg white drip down between your fingers into a large bowl. Reserve the yolk in a separate, smaller bowl. Repeat with second egg.</li>
        <li>Pour vinegar into the egg whites, add salt, and whip with a whisk until we have relatively firm, but not dry, peaks.</li>
        <li>Spoon onto the prepared baking sheet, making sure they are not too wide, as we want some height here. Shape as desired and make a small depression in the top centers using a spoon for yolks.</li>
        <li>Bake in center of the preheated oven until they just start to take on some golden color, 5 to 6 minutes. Add yolks and bake until yolks are heated through, but still runny, 3 to 4 minutes more. Serve on butter toast.</li>
      </ol>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>
          I used champagne vinegar but literally any kind will work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most common mistake with these is overwhipping the whites. Don't use an electric mixer for these.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wanted to dress this up by adding fresh chives, tarragon, or dill, that wouldn't be a bad idea. Or, you could do some kind of eggs Benedict presentation and serve on top of an English muffin with Canadian bacon--in which case you'd probably want to use lemon juice instead of vinegar in the egg whites.
