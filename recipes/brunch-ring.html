      <h2>Directions</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat oven to 375°F (350°F for Pillsbury™ Grands!™ Original Crescent Rolls). Line large cookie sheet with
          cooking parchment paper. In 10-inch nonstick skillet, cook bacon over medium heat about 4 minutes or until
          cooked but not crisp, turning once. (It will continue to cook in oven.) Set bacon aside; drain all except 2
          teaspoons bacon drippings from skillet.

        </li>
        <li>
          In medium bowl, beat 1/3 cup of the milk, the eggs, salt and pepper with fork or whisk until well mixed. Stir
          in bell pepper. Pour egg mixture into skillet. As mixture heats, portions of eggs will begin to set. Gently
          push cooked portions with metal spatula to outside edge of skillet. Avoid stirring constantly. As more egg
          sets, push it to edge, and place it on top of the already set egg mixture. Cook 2 to 3 minutes or until eggs
          are thickened throughout but still moist.

        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, unroll dough; separate into 8 triangles. On parchment-lined cookie sheet, arrange triangles with
          shortest sides toward center, overlapping in star shape and leaving 4-inch round circle open in center (see
          diagram). Crescent dough points may hang over edge of cookie sheet. Press overlapping dough to flatten.

        </li>
        <li>
          Place bacon on each of the triangles. Sprinkle 1/3 cup of the cheese onto widest part of dough. Spoon eggs
          over cheese. Sprinkle with 1/3 cup of the cheese. Pull points of triangles over eggs and cheese, and tuck
          under dough to form ring (filling will be visible). Carefully brush dough with remaining 1 tablespoon milk;
          sprinkle with remaining 1/3 cup cheese.

        </li>
        <li>
          Bake 20 to 25 minutes (18 to 23 minutes for Grands!™ crescents) or until deep golden brown. Cool 5 minutes.
          With broad spatula, carefully loosen ring from cookie sheet; slide onto serving platter. Garnish with cilantro
          and salsa.
        </li>
      </ol>

        <h2>Notes</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Make your own Mexican cheese blend for this breakfast crescent ring! Mix 1/2 cup each shredded mozzarella,
            shredded provolone, shredded cheddar and grated Parmesan cheeses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Garnish each serving of this Bacon, Egg and Cheese Brunch Ring with chopped tomato, cilantro, green onions,
            sour cream or salsa.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tip: Bacon grease is a mess. For easy cleanup, carefully pour it into a “bowl” made of foil, then fold in
            edges and toss once grease has cooled. More smart foil tips.

            Pillsbury™ Grands!™ Crescent Dinner Rolls come in Butter Flake and Original flavors; be sure to adjust
            temperature and time as indicated to prevent over-browning while making this breakfast ring with Crescent
            Rolls.
